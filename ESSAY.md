I am Oluwafemi Akindele Sanya, an academic staff in the Department of Computing, Afe Babalola University, Nigeria, where I have been teaching since November 2016. I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Afe Babalola University (2018), where my thesis focused on designing a Dynamic Traffic Routing System using Q-Learning and Markov Decision Processes. I also hold a B.Sc. from Lead City University (2010) and a Diploma in Computer Technology from Obafemi Awolowo University (2005). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science.



My research interests span Cyber Security, Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering. I have authored and co-authored multiple peer-reviewed publications on topics including machine learning classifiers for breast cancer detection, IoT-based health monitoring, deep learning for energy prediction, and AI-powered disease detection systems among others.



My coding experience includes proficiency in Java and Python, with extensive work in machine learning frameworks and mobile development. I teach courses ranging from Object-Oriented Programming to Formal Methods of Software Engineering and Introduction to Problem Solving, which keeps me engaged with modern development practices.



The idea behind my project, DataTruth, emerged from a common consumer frustration in Nigeria: suspected discrepancies between actual data and airtime usage versus what network providers report. Users often suspect overcharging but lack tools to verify independently. DataTruth monitors real-time data consumption, call durations, and SMS counts directly on the device, then compares these metrics against provider-reported usage to identify discrepancies and empower and/or inform consumers.



I developed DataTruth using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) to share business logic across Android and iOS from a single codebase. The technology stack includes Compose Multiplatform for UI, SQLDelight for local data persistence, Koin for dependency injection, and platform-specific modules for accessing system-level usage statistics. This project demonstrates KMP's potential for solving real-world consumer protection challenges.
